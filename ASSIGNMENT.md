[demo example](https://jalu.ch/coding/hearts/hearts.php)
###Deadlines:
Completed project due Wednesday, 7/28;  Present to class Thursday 7/29
Completed list of features & task assignments (who is responsible for what) due by stand-up Wednesday AM (7/14). Also by Wednesday, elect a team lead who will: report progress back to Terence & Sylwinn every few days and to help ensure that the team members are on-task (maybe this means problem solving the task, breaking it down further, or pairing folks to do it together, etc)

###Expectations for a minimum viable product:
- 4 player game (all human players)
- Each player is dealt 13 cards
- Program should use the entire 52 card deck on each deal .
- MVP program should not support passing
- MVP should programmatically determine which player takes the trick on each round
- Program should shuffle the cards before each deal
- Program should keep score for each player and end when the first player reaches 50 points.
- Program should be organized using classes and objects in a driver class.
- Program will be played on the command line.
- Program should have unit tests.
- Program should have a comprehensive README with directions for playing the game as well as documentation about the program.


###Reach for the Stars goals (these should be done after the above is completed):
- Excellent programs will store scores of players in an external file and read it in again at startup, allowing play to be saved and to resume later.
- Excellent programs will allow for either human or computer players at any position (that is: anywhere from 0-4 human players should be supported with the computer playing all remaining roles)
- Excellent programs will do one of the following:
    - use a JavaFX to create a GUI
  - Refactor to make a Spring RESTful API

###To Turn In:
The expectation is that every person in the group will have contributed. Your team will be given a repository and invited to collaborate on it. You will have all remaining mornings and some afternoons to work on this project.
